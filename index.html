          <h3>Description:</h3>

          <p>This workshop is intended to reach out to women and high school students who are new to Ruby and Rails and want to learn more about programming for web applications. Men, you are welcome to attend with a woman who wants to learn Ruby on Rails and brings you as a guest.</p>
          <p>In this workshop, we'll take you through building a complete web application using Ruby on Rails. By the end of the workshop, you'll have an application on the internet that connects to a database and reads and writes information. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend workshop day learning and writing code.</p>
          <p>Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all welcome. We'll have different classes separated by experience level. Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer.</p>
          <p>When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating system, level and type of programming experience, and whether you will require childcare. Childcare and private space for nursing or pumping is available -- just let us know.</p>
          <p>(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.)</p>
          <p>We love having additional volunteers, both folks who know Ruby on Rails to TA and people who are willing to help with logistics. If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to contact the organizer.</p>
